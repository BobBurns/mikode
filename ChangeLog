* run.c got rid of seperate program mrun
instead just run mikode -r to execute compiled bin

* this is for version 1.0.1 added getopt support
help version run options

* got rid of those pesky compiler warnings for braces
around the instruction struct. And moved the whole thing
to a new file opcode.c so the compiler won't complain 
about ins not being used.

* minor bug fix compiler warning for err in execute.c
and reg[3] out of bounds
