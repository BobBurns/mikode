** fixed bug in execute.c SubtractImm wrong opcode
0x5000 not 0x6000

** change error to print line nuber in decimal
not hex.  Added example hkstr.asm to examples for
hackster.io page. still needs testing on Pi`

* Release version 1.1.0 Revising readme and man page
merge pi_gpio branch to master.  Added ncurses raw()
to run.c to capture ^c so I can unexport GPIO before
exiting. I successfully tested blinking an led and
reading input. Example files: examples/blink.asm
examples/read.asm Also, made a simple man page for
distribution.

** adding support for raspberry pi gpio.  Should
probably started a new branch.  configure.ac checks for 
/opt/vc/include/bcm_host.h now.  mikode takes
--gpio or -g arguement to run with gpio. Note:
this slows down execution considerably

** reformating for gnu standard using indent
commiting version 1.0.2 and uploading

** added support for checking input file in
parse.c. Check for file, check for .asm handle
null file pointer.

** changing AddWithCarry to AddWithC for consistency
with SubtractWithC

* run.c got rid of seperate program mrun
instead just run mikode -r to execute compiled bin

* this is for version 1.0.1 added getopt support
help version run options

* got rid of those pesky compiler warnings for braces
around the instruction struct. And moved the whole thing
to a new file opcode.c so the compiler won't complain 
about ins not being used.

* minor bug fix compiler warning for err in execute.c
and reg[3] out of bounds
