Mikode


Mikode is an Assembly language Compiler and Emulator, written as a tool to
teach kids. The Syntax is a little less daunting, with Instructions like 
LoadImm instead of LDA or Increment instead of INC.

The Compiler parses this faux Assembly code into binary instructions based
off the Atmel AVR MCU.

The Emulator has an address space of 64K including Monitor ROM to display 
characters to the screen.

The inspiration to write this program came from the desire to teach kids 
and interested adults about the foundations of computer logic.

Using Mikode, one should ultimately be able to teach how to write simple 
games in Assembly.

Doesn't that sound like fun?

Be sure to read BUGS and INSTALL.

Building

Mikode uses a fork of the recursie descent parse, TinyExpr 
that has been modified to handle bitwise instructions. Nothing
needs to be done for this.

Mikode requires the ncurses library. This can be installed
via apt install libcurses-dev

See INSTALL for detailed instructions, but you should be able
to build with './configure; make' and then 'sudo make install'

-----

Examples

Checkout the examples directory and compile example1.asm with
'mikode example1.asm' then run it with 'mrun example1'

Tutorials will be coming soon.
